Create a three-tier distributed application that displays the user interface in a browser 
using XHTML. The middle tier is a JSP that handles requests from the client browser 
and provides access to the third tierâ€”a Cloudscape database accessed via JDBC. The 
JSP in this example is a survey that allows users to vote for their favorite animal. The 
document Survey.html contains five radio buttons (Dog, Cat, Parrot, Cow and None) 
and a Submit button. When the JSP receives a post request from the Survey.html 
document, the JSP updates the total number of votes for that animal in the database 
and returns a dynamically generated XHTML document containing the survey results 
to the client. The result should display the number of responses and vote percentage 
for each pet. Also display the total number of responses obtained.
