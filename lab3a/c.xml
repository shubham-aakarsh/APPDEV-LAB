Dear Melvile, 
I have been reading your ideas concering the nature of 
librarianship, and I find them very intriguing. I would love the 
opportunity to discuss with you the role of the card catalog in today's 
libraries considering the advent to World Wide Web. Specifically, how 
are things like Google and Amazon.com changing our patrons' expectations 
of library services? Mr. Cutter and I will be discussing these ideas at 
the next Annual Meeting, and we are available at the follow dates/times: 
* Monday, 2-4 
* Tuesday, 3-5 
* Thursday, 1-3 
We hope you can join us. 
Sincerely,  
James k Robert
