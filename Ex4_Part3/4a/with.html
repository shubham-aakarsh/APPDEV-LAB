Ex.No.4: Programs using Java Script – Part III 
4.a. Write a JavaScript program to perform the following String 
Manipulation Operations with and without using the methods 
of String Object. 
I.  To search for the first occurrence of a substring in a 
given string 
II.  To return the character at a specified index 
III.  To concatenate two string objects 
4.b. Write a JavaScript that inputs text from an XHTML form and outputs 
it in Upper case and Lower case letters. 
4.c. Write a JavaScript that reads a Five-Letter word from the user and 
produces all possible Three-Letter words that can be derived from 
the letters of the Five-Letter word. 
For example, the three-letter words produced from the word “bathe” 
include the commonly used words : ate bat bet tab hat the tea 
4.d. Write a JavaScript to display the current time and print the message 
according to the time. For example, Good Morning in Morning, 
Good After Noon in Noon, Good Evening in evening and Good 
Night in Night. 
4.e. Write a JavaScript program to perform Merge Sort for a given set of 
N numbers dynamically prompted from the user. (Use user defined 
function to perform Merge Sort).
